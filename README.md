## ENS Homepage V2

### Translations

    Translations use `react-i18next` and translations are located in: `locales/language/translation.json`.

    Please copy the `en.translation.json` and add the translation to allow us to add a new language

### Development

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory, start your console and run the local development server:

    ```shell
    cd ensdomains-v2/
    yarn
    yarn develop
    ```

    Now you can access your site locally at `http://localhost:8000`.
